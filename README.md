What environmental features contribute to successful breeding of Little Penguins on Penguin Island WA.

## Objectives
The primary aims of this project are to:
1. Investigate relationships between nest characteristics, microclimate, nest use and reproductive success:
1.1. Examine how nest characteristics influence nest microclimate (temperature and humidity) on Penguin Island. 
1.2. Define characteristics of (artificial and natural) nests relative to nest utilisation of little penguins on Penguin Island. 
1.3. Investigate how microclimate and nest characteristics influence breeding success of little penguins on Penguin Island. 
2. Test a range of artificial nest designs and assess their capacity to provide high quality nest habitat as measured by use and microclimatic environment relative to natural nest burrows.

## Research Questions
1. How do physical characteristics influence nest microclimate?
2. How do microclimate and physical characteristics influence use and breeding success of penguin nests?
